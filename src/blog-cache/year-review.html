        <h1>Year Review</h1>
        <p>This year has been a very transformative year for me. I've learnt alot from my experiences in NS. I think that I've become a better person as a result. I wish to share the things that I've done and learnt as the year comes to an end.</p>
        <p>1. "Saikang"<br>Before army, I've always tried to do the bare minimum as long as it is not academically related. This means that most of the tedious work that I've had to do in projects or in CCAs are often done half-heartedly. Previously, I saw no point in doing those work which had ultimately no effect on my report card/ A-levels cert. Jump into unit life, I realised that doing saikang was a large part of my in-camp life. Besides the usual rifle cleaning, there was stores maintenance, toilet cleaning, clearing of trash, multiple guard duties, volunteering for battalion events and many more. I've found that the proper attitude towards "saikang" that had worked for me was to not think too much about it. In essence, the Nike tagline - "Just do it!". From these experiences, I've realised how entitled I was during my schooling days and that I've became more grounded and empathetic as a result.</p>
        <p>2. Standing up myself<br>I thought that during a large part of my BMT days and most of my schooling days, I've been a very quiet and reserved person. Hence, my needs and wants were often not prioritised. I think that it was when I was assimilating myself to my unit that I've found out that it was very demoralising to be the pushover in the group for the group members and myself. While standing up for myself did involve me being a little more aggressive and uptight than usual, I've felt that I've taken more control of how other people treat me and in turn I felt better about myself.</p>
        <p>3. Teamwork<br>I was put in an environment where failing to work in a team leads to severe problems in getting work done. As a result of many trainings, I've learnt the importance of a good team and how to properly do my part in a team-setting.</p>
        <p>The first part of the year was not very kind to me, I'll admit. However, I think that it was for the better as I've now learnt valuable lessons that would serve me well later on in life.</p>
