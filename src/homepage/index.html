                    <span class="blog__description">Software Defined â€“ Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) has become the new buzzword in the world of networking. But what exactly is Software Defined Networking (SDN)? In the SDN architecture, the control and data planes are decoupled. Network intelligence and logic are managed from a centralized management interface instead of managing it on the physical network device itself. Gone are the days where network engineers console or remote into each network device and configure it manually. With Software Defined Networking, it offers a scalable solution for managing many different network devices...</span>

                    <span class="blog__description">Update: My blog has reached more than 500 views!! Never knew so many people would be interested in reading about my life... I am incredibly humbled and grateful to you guys for spending time to read some of my blogs. CCNA  I have successfully passed both ICND 1 and ICND 2 since late June, hence making me CCNA certified! Honestly, I felt that I really pushed myself to learn more about networks and I wasn't quite sure that I was able to pass the Cisco exams as I heard that it was quite difficult. There were many times when I spent entire weekends and a few hours after work to study...</span>

                    <span class="blog__description">It has been quite a while since the last blog update >&lt; It has been a very eye-opening experience these few months at work and in school as I get exposed to different aspects of the IT industry. This period has been a non-stop learning period for me as I get my hands on servers, workstations, switches, routers and managing IT end-users who have no idea about IT (i.e. patience-training). </span>

                    <span class="blog__description">As of writing, I've completed my final outfield evaluation and my milestone parade. It has been a swell ride. Since my NS journey is coming to an end, I would like to express my feelings through this blog post. I ended off last year with 3 life lessons from the army(ref 'Year Review' blog post). This year, I think that I've enjoyed the experiences I've had because of the values that have been imbued into me last year. While saikang has always been a constant in the life of a pioneer, I've found that I'm so used to doing extra work that I always expect it. So that when saikang needs to...</span>

                    <span class="blog__description">This year has been a very transformative year for me. I've learnt alot from my experiences in NS. I think that I've become a better person as a result. I wish to share the things that I've done and learnt as the year comes to an end. 1. "Saikang" Before army, I've always tried to do the bare minimum as long as it is not academically related. This means that most of the tedious work that I've had to do in projects or in CCAs are often done half-heartedly. Previously, I saw no point in doing those work which had ultimately no effect on my report card/ A-levels cert... </span>

                    <span class="blog__description">I've been dabbling into the strange world of morals and ethics during these few months. After reading the Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*** and WINNING WITH HONOR, I felt that there were valuable moral lessons that are worth sharing to others. 1. Entitlement A big theme of morals involve the feeling of entitlement. Simply put, it means the idea that we deserve something (usually positive) without putting in the required amount of effort into it. I admit that I was an entitled teenager as I always felt the need to feel positive and accomodating to others. As a result, I sometimes felt...</span>
