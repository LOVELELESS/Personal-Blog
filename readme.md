#Rayson's Personal Blog
###link: rayson-koh.netlify.com

##Introduction
###This was created using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
###I wanted to practice sass, flexbox and grid too so there were elements of flexbox and grid in the style.scss.
###For the dev workflow, I used webpack to bundle javascript files, using html-webpack-plugin, style-loader and css-loader to mirror the html files in my src folder and inject the css files.

##Things that could be improved
###I created this website using a mobile-first approach. So it may not look as optimised for desktop view.
###Images in contact-me and about-me pages are slightly off on bigger screens. 
###More functionality - maybe a function for people to comment on posts?
###More efficient way of loading blogs - storing the text files on a database and retrieving the files on-demand??
