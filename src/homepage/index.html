                <span class="blog__description">Software Defined â€“ Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) has become the new buzzword in the world of networking. But what exactly is Software Defined Networking (SDN)? In the SDN architecture, the control and data planes are decoupled. Network intelligence and logic are managed from a centralized management interface instead of managing it on the physical network device itself. Gone are the days where network engineers console or remote into each network device and configure it manually. With Software Defined Networking, it offers a scalable solution for managing many different network devices...</span>

                <span class="blog__description">It has been quite a while since the last blog update >&lt; It has been a very eye-opening experience these few months at work and in school as I get exposed to different aspects of the IT industry. This period has been a non-stop learning period for me as I get my hands on servers, workstations, switches, routers and managing IT end-users who have no idea about IT (i.e. patience-training). </span>
