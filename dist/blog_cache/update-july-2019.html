        <h1>Update July 2019: Internship, University and Self-study</h1>
        <p class="highlight">Update: My blog has reached more than 500 views!! Never knew so many people would be interested in reading about my life... I am incredibly humbled and grateful to you guys for spending time to read some of my blogs.</p>
        <h2>CCNA</h2>
        <p>I have successfully passed both ICND 1 and ICND 2 since late June, hence making me CCNA certified! Honestly, I felt that I really pushed myself to learn more about networks and I wasn't quite sure that I was able to pass the Cisco exams as I heard that it was quite difficult. There were many times when I spent entire weekends and a few hours after work to study.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, I felt that my efforts paid off and I have to thank one of my seniors at work, Khine, for introducing to me CCNA certification, providing me with tips and giving suggestions on certain networking concepts based on his experience. He was the one who always encouraged me to study for CCNA and I really do owe my CCNA certificate to him.</p>
        <h2>Internship</h2>
        <p>I recently ended my 6 months stint at a small SI company. I am really grateful to everyone there for their patient guidance during my first few months as I have completely 0 knowledge about computer networks, servers and IT support in general.</p>
        <p>I really liked working there because of the people and the warm culture there. While I've been used to do the usual office saikang, my supervisor, Fazeer, also gave me a lot of freedom with regards to what I want to learn and even allowed me to be the lead engineer for a project for a global big-shot company. Because of that, I went to many of the clients' places and learnt a lot about the soft skills needed to manage endpoint users and managers who are not IT savvy.</p>
        <h2>University</h2>
        <p>I am about to start university studies soon. My course of study is Computer Science. Really excited to be able to learn about a wealth of areas within Com.Sci such as Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms, Computer Networks, Database and Computer Security! If only I could be a sponge and just soak up all the juicy knowledge.</p>
        <p>People have also advised me that university is a good time to find a girlfriend... For me, I would just let fate decide. If it is meant to be, it is meant to be :)</p>
        <h2>On the Side</h2>
        <p>I realised from University Orientation programs, I am more of an introvert and do not really prefer rah-rah activities. It just feels so superficial in my opinion.</p>
        <p>I am currently learning Web Dev, hopefully I can become a competent front-end developer and start with a few basic projects to practice my skills. I hope to transition to a full-stack developer in 1-2 years.</p>
        <p>After internship has ended, I took the time to meet with certain people who are important in my life. It was good to catch up with their life and just enjoy their company. I have to make a mental note to remind myself to catch up with them on a regular basis to sustain the relationship.</p>
