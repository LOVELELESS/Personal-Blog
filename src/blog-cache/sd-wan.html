        <h1>Software Defined Networking</h1>
        <p>Software Defined â€“ Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) has become the new buzzword in the world of networking. But what exactly is Software Defined Networking (SDN)?</p>
        <p>In the SDN architecture, the control and data planes are decoupled. Network intelligence and logic are managed from a centralized management interface instead of managing it on the physical network device itself.</p>
        <p>Gone are the days where network engineers console or remote into each network device and configure it manually. With Software Defined Networking, it offers a scalable solution for managing many different network devices from a central management point. Here are the benefits that Software Defined Networking can bring to the enterprise.</p>
        <h2>Feature 1: Zero-Touch Deployment</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, organisations will order network equipments, stage it at a central location to load configurations, then transport it to the deployment site. With the Zero-Touch Deployment feature, organisations can bypass the aforementioned flow and transport the equipment to the deployment site straight after ordering the network equipment. The Zero-Touch Deployment feature allows new network equipments to securely communicate with a SDN controller to validate the device and load configuration. This helps to reduce deployment time from 2-4 weeks to a couple of days!</p>
        <h2>Feature 2: Path Trace</h2>
        <p>In enterprise networks, it is highly complex and device to device troubleshooting and maintenance takes up a lot of man-hours and resources. Using the SDN controller, the network engineer is able to get a visualization of the enterprise network topology in real-time with detailed device-level data. With the Path Trace functionality, the engineer can solve network connectivity problems by automating the inspection and interrogation of the flow taken by a business application in the network. Hence, with this feature, it significantly reduces network troubleshooting and maintenance time especially in large enterprise networks or WANs.</p>
        <h2>Feature 3: Easy Quality-Of-Service (Easy QOS)</h2>
        <p>Implementing the right QOS policies across voice, video and data traffic can be the difference between a good and great network. As more devices are added to the network, it makes implementing QOS policies more complicated. Using the SDN controller, it removes the operational complexity of management and configuration. Instead of making the network engineer understand the inner workings of each networking device and how to prioritize individual applications, they just need to know what applications are important to their business and let Easy QOS perform the nitty-gritty behind-the-scenes configurations.</p>
