        <h1>End of ATEC; ORD</h1>
        <p>As of writing, I've completed my final outfield evaluation and my milestone parade. It has been a swell ride. Since my NS journey is coming to an end, I would like to express my feelings through this blog post.</p>
        <p>I ended off last year with 3 life lessons from the army(ref 'Year Review' blog post). This year, I think that I've enjoyed the experiences I've had because of the values that have been imbued into me last year. While saikang has always been a constant in the life of a pioneer, I've found that I'm so used to doing extra work that I always expect it. So that when saikang needs to be done suddenly, I am able to do it. Regarding the act of standing up for myself and my needs, I've also learnt to be more sensitive with my words and actions while also finding humour through self-deprecating jokes. There were many times when things got heated and negative things were said. I've learnt to counter those through light-hearted humour most of the time. However, if those criticism were justified, I would deeply reflect on it. All in all, I think that the appropriate word to describe this would be perspective. Lastly, the spirit of teamwork was strengthened through many bouts of training and outfields together in year 2. Many issues regarding teamwork were ironed out and it led to a very chill ATEC at the end.</p>
        <p>After paying homage to last year's lessons learnt, there are still some new things that I've learnt in year 2.</p>
        <p>1. Class<br>I have come to realise that how one portrays himself to the rest is important as how others would treat oneself is dependent on it. This includes one's mannerisms, treatment towards others across all ranks and leadership. As a result, I've become more aware of how I'm being portrayed towards others as first impressions are of the utmost importance to building a good reputation. People treat people based on their reputation. I have seen commanders that are good at operations but bad at people relations not being properly recognised for their hard work. Earning the respect of men across all ranks is very hard but I have also seen people who have done so. I think that my reputation is good, but it could've been better if I had shown some more leadership, initiative and networked better with my peers. I think I came off as being a little aloof to some and hence, still need to work on my networking skills.</p>
        <p>2. Going the extra mile<br>After a very shag activity such as overnight outfield, everyone just wants to go back to bunk and have a nice shower. However, especially as a pioneer, the recovery stage is crucial since we have many heavy equipments and some small ones that may get lost. It is when everyone is shag that an opportunity arises for someone to go the extra mile and take up the mantle of leadership. True character will be shown during the most tiring times. Admittedly, I am guilty of just following orders most of the time(man-mode) and not showing initiative when it is needed most. Hence, I feel that this is an area where I can improve on.</p>
        <p>3. Self-Acceptance<br>People are not perfect. We are born with strengths and weaknesses physically and mentally. Certain morally defunct people would use your weaknesses as ammunition to gun you down psychologically. However, if you have a strong sense of self and truely accept your strengths and weaknesses, they have no power over you. I've learnt that using humour is an effective tool to disarm those people who intend to hurt you using your weaknesses.</p>
        <p>In my 2nd year of NS, I've enjoyed the fruits of the painful lessons learnt in the first year. With more experiences, I've broadened my horizons and gained greater perspectives.</p>
