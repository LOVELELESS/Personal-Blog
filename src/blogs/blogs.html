                <div class="description">
                    <p>I have successfully passed both ICND 1 and ICND 2 since late June, hence making me CCNA certified! Honestly, I felt that I really pushed myself to learn more about networks and I wasn't quite sure that I was able to pass the Cisco exams as I heard that it was quite difficult. There were many times when I spent entire weekends and a few hours after work to study.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>It has been a very eye-opening experience these few months at work and in school as I get exposed to different aspects of the IT industry. This period has been a non-stop learning period for me as I get my hands on servers, workstations, switches, routers and managing IT end-users who have no idea about IT (i.e. patience-training).</p>

                    <p>This year has been a very transformative year for me. I've learnt alot from my experiences in NS. I think that I've become a better person as a result. I wish to share the things that I've done and learnt as the year comes to an end.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>I've been dabbling into the strange world of morals and ethics during these few months. After reading the Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*** and WINNING WITH HONOR, I felt that there were valuable moral lessons that are worth sharing to others.</p>
